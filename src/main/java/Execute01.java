        NOTES about execute() method
        1. execute() method returns boolean
        2. It can be used with DDL(create, alter, drop table), DQL (reading the data using SELECT), DML (add, update data)
        3. execute() method with ddl and dml => always returns FALSE
        4. execute() method with dql => can return TRUE or FALSE because it checks whether ResultSet is created or not.
                                         With SELECT statement,  ResultSet will be created every time, so it will return true
                                         indicating that rows exist (even if they're empty at the moment)

            SUMMARY:

             The execute() method is designed to handle any type of SQL statement, not just queries.
             Its versatility is one of its strengths.When it returns true, it signals that the SQL statement executed
             was a query that generated a ResultSet.
             If the execute() method were to return false, it would mean that the statement executed was an
             update, insert, delete, or a DDL statement, which does not produce a ResultSet.

chatGPT Notes about execute() method:

In JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), the execute() method can be used to execute any SQL statement.
This method is designed to handle different types of SQL queries, including DDL (Data Definition Language),
DML (Data Manipulation Language), and DQL (Data Query Language) statements. When dealing with DQL, specifically,
the execute() method returns true for a couple of reasons:

Result Set Indication: The primary reason is to indicate that the execution of the SQL statement has produced a ResultSet.
DQL statements, such as SELECT queries, are expected to return data from the database. When execute() is called and
a SELECT statement is executed, a ResultSet object is generated, which contains the data retrieved by the query.
The method returning true signifies that this ResultSet is available and can be processed.

Versatility of execute() Method: The execute() method is designed to handle any type of SQL statement, not just queries.
 Its versatility is one of its strengths. When it returns true, it signals that the SQL statement executed was a query
 that generated a ResultSet. If the execute() method were to return false, it would mean that the statement executed
 was an update, insert, delete, or a DDL statement, which does not produce a ResultSet.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how the execute() method works in the context of different types of SQL statements:

SELECT Statements (DQL): These statements are meant to retrieve data from the database. When such a statement is
executed, execute() returns true to indicate that a ResultSet has been produced.

INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE Statements (DML): These statements modify the data in the database but do not
produce a ResultSet. When such a statement is executed, execute() returns false.

DDL Statements: These statements alter the schema of the database (e.g., CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE).
These also do not produce a ResultSet, so execute() returns false.
